                    <p>It was 2017 and legend has it, a few friends were enjoying some tea together. As is common with Southeast Asians, they started ranting about how hard it was to get a taxi.

                        But afterwards, they did something uncommon.</p>

                    <p>They decided to solve the problem. They started us, Angkorcab.com ,  Pretty soon, our simple goal had transformed into something bigger â€“ to make Southeast Asia a better place</p>
